# SpectralElements

Experiments and developments for the spectral element method.

This repository will contain a number of codes utilized to investigate and
understand spectral elements. Additionally the goal is to setup an understanding
wide enough to develop tools for Adjoint sensitivity analysis testing which can
be migrated to other projects as needed.

## Literature

A number of different books and articles will provide the basis for this
development and testing.
